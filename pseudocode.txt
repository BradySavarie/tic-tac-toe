Tic Tac mother fucking Toe bitches lets go

Main Components:
    gameBoard Module
    gameController Module
    displayController Module

Im going to start by creating a gameBoard module. Inside of the module an empty 2D array called board will be initialized along with variables representing the number of rows and columns on the board. A cell module will live within this scope and will be used to update and retrieve the marker values on each cell of the gameBoard. A nested for loop will run immediately after the cell module with the outer loop representing rows and the inner loop representing columns. It will call the cell modules getMarker method to set the default marker value of each cell on the gameBoard to 0. 

I will need a gameController module that is responsible for handling the flow of the game. The first thing this module should do is create both player objects. To accomplish this I will create a factory function called playerFactory that accepts the parameters name and marker.

I want the user to be able to choose which letter they are playing (X or O) and input a name. Whichever player chooses X will always start the first game, however each time the play again button is clicked the starting player will alternate.
