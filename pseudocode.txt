Tic Tac mother fucking Toe bitches lets go

Main Components:
    Player Factory Function
    gameBoard Module
    gameController Module
    displayController Module

Im going to start by creating a gameboard object and organizing it to be a module. Inside the gameboard object I will initialize an empty gameboard array. 

The gameboard will need to have 3 rows and 3 columns which can be represented by a 2D array. Each index within the gameboard array will represent a row, and each index that represents a row will itself be an array that has an index for each column. For example, if I need to access the cell in the center of the gameboard than I would target gameboard[1][1] (row 2, column 2).

Each cell will begin by being populated with an empty button so that it can easily trigger click events. To populate each cell I can use a nested loop that iterates through the rows and columns of the gameboard and inserts a button. It may be helpful to give each button a unique data attribute so that it can be easily targetted. This process could be carried out as a method called init that is stored inside of a gameController module. This module will be responsible for handling the flow of the game.

I will also need a way to represent the players in the game. For now I will make it a two player game, however I may extend functionality in the future to include the choice of playing a bot. Players can be created using a factory function that accepts name and letter as input and stores them as properties/methods. 

I want the user to be able to choose which letter they are playing (X or O) and input a name. Whichever player chooses X will always start the first game, however each time the play again button is clicked the starting player will alternate.
