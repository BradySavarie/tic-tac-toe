Tic Tac mother fucking Toe bitches lets go

Main Components:
    gameBoard Module
    gameController Module
    displayController Module

Im going to start by creating a gameBoard module. Inside of the module an empty 2D array called board will be initialized along with variables representing the number of rows and columns on the board. A cell module will live within this scope and will be used to update and retrieve the marker values on each cell of the gameBoard. A nested for loop will run immediately after the cell module with the outer loop representing rows and the inner loop representing columns. It will call the cell modules getMarker method to set the default marker value of each cell on the gameBoard to 0. 

A gameController module will be used to handle the flow of the game. It will contain the methods createPlayers, initializeActivePlayer, switchTurns, getActivePlayer, and placeMarker. 

The createPlayers method will loop through the displayController.playerData array as playerFactory parameters and store the resulting objects in the players array once the game has a UI implemented. The console version will accept manual input for now.

A displayController module will be needed in the UI version of the game to retrieve data from users and display content once processed. The displayController method will need to gather user input data via a getPlayerData method and store it in a publicly accessible playerData array.
